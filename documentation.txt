Kitako Hackathon Documentation
Track: ESG+E2 â€“ Financial Inclusion & Sustainable Business Growth
Challenge Statement: AI Agents for Ethical Microfinance Lending
Executive Summary
The Philippines faces a profound financial inclusion crisis that disproportionately affects informal workers, freelancers, and gig economy participants. With 73% of farmers having no formal accounts and 45% of self-employed individuals remaining unbanked, traditional financial institutions consistently fail to serve populations operating within the informal economy. This exclusion stems from structural barriers including lack of standardized income documentation, high documentary requirements (cited by 40% of unbanked adults), and insufficient funds (reported by 45% of financially excluded individuals).
Kitako addresses this critical gap through an AI-powered proof-of-income platform that transforms alternative financial data into verifiable documentation, enabling ethical microfinance lending at scale while reducing operational costs and promoting financial inclusivity. By integrating seamlessly with institutions like the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) and its microfinance arm BanKo, Kitako complements BPI's digital inclusion initiatives, such as BanKo's mobile banking services for self-employed micro vendors (SEMVs), to expand access to loans and savings for underserved populations.
Introduction
The Financial Inclusion Crisis in the Philippines
The Philippines exhibits stark financial exclusion patterns, with 34.3 million adults (44% of the total adult population) remaining unbanked as of 2021, despite significant improvements from previous years. This exclusion is particularly acute among specific worker categories:

Agricultural workers: 73% exclusion rate - the highest among all occupational categories
Private household workers: 48% unbanked
Self-employed individuals: 45% without formal accounts
Workers with primary education: 66% exclusion rate

Income volatility represents a fundamental barrier for freelancers and gig workers, who face "irregular workloads, inconsistent client payments, and the short-term nature of projects" as major sources of financial instability. Research confirms that financial institutions view freelancers as high-risk clients due to their inconsistent earnings, systematically preventing them from accessing credit, loans, or basic banking services.
BPI, through its subsidiary BanKo, has made strides in addressing this via mobile-based savings and microloans for unbanked Filipinos. However, gaps persist in verifying income for informal workers, which Kitako aims to bridge by providing AI-generated proof-of-income compatible with BanKo's digital platforms.
The Growing Gig Economy Challenge
The Philippines' gig economy has experienced explosive growth, with e-wallet usage reaching 87% adoption among Southeast Asian countries according to the 2024 Visa Consumer Payment Attitudes Study. Digital wallets are expected to comprise 30% of total e-commerce transaction value by 2028, up from 24% in 2023, representing a market projected to reach USD $6.20 billion by 2029.
However, this digital transformation has created a paradox: while 83% of Filipino workers are informally employed, they increasingly operate through digital platforms that generate valuable financial data, yet remain excluded from traditional credit assessment models that require formal employment documentation. Kitako's solution aligns with BPI's push for digital financial inclusion, enhancing BanKo's services by incorporating alternative data for more accurate risk assessments.
Microfinance Industry Limitations
The Philippine microfinance sector faces significant operational challenges that limit its effectiveness in serving informal workers. Industry analysis reveals portfolio at risk (PAR-30) rates of 8.59% on average, higher than regional benchmarks. Key institutional challenges include:

Spread of credit pollution and governance issues
Non-adoption of performance standards by MFIs
Lack of proper lending technology and effective internal control systems
Insufficient outreach to underserved populations

These limitations underscore the need for AI-powered solutions that can process alternative data sources to enable more accurate credit risk assessment while reducing operational overhead. By partnering with BPI, Kitako can integrate with BanKo's ecosystem to streamline these processes for microfinance providers.
Problem Statement
Documentation Barriers
Traditional proof-of-income requirements systematically exclude informal workers who lack:

Standardized employment contracts
Regular payroll documentation
Formal business registration
Traditional credit histories

The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) 2021 Financial Inclusion Survey reveals that 40% of unbanked adults cite lack of documentary requirements as a primary barrier to account ownership, while 54% remain unaware of simplified Basic Deposit Account (BDA) products designed to address these challenges.
Alternative Data Opportunities
Despite exclusion from formal financial systems, informal workers generate substantial digital footprints through:

E-wallet transactions (36% of Filipino adults maintain e-money accounts)
Mobile payment histories across 397 million mobile wallet accounts
Bank statement fragments from irregular transactions
Digital marketplace receipts from gig economy platforms

Research demonstrates that machine learning algorithms analyzing alternative data can improve credit classification accuracy by 12% on average compared to traditional models, while psychometric data and digital footprints provide superior predictive power for previously unbanked populations.
Microfinance Operational Inefficiencies

Manual processing overhead requiring significant staff time for document verification
