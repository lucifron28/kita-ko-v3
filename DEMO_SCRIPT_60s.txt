Kitako – 60‑Second Demo Script (Accurate to MVP)

0:00 – Title
“Kitako: AI‑assisted proof‑of‑income for informal workers.”

0:03 – Login
“Log in to the web app. The UI uses a dark theme and JWT auth.”

0:06 – Upload
“Go to Upload. Add a bank/e‑wallet statement PDF or CSV. The backend stores a FileUpload record and starts processing.”

0:12 – Extraction & Review
“Transactions are extracted with LLM‑assist or rule fallback. The system moves the file to ‘awaiting_review’. Open the Review modal to edit categories, amounts, or descriptions, then approve.”

0:22 – Reports
“Create a report for a date range and purpose. Generate PDF. The backend builds a professional ReportLab PDF with income breakdown, summary, and a QR code.”

0:32 – QR Verification
“Scan the QR or visit the public verification page at /verify/<code>. The PDF no longer prints a verification status—verification is live on the website and can be updated by admins.”

0:42 – Download & Share
“Download the PDF from Reports. Lenders verify authenticity online using the QR; no reprints required.”

0:48 – Security & Stack
“Django + DRF backend with PostgreSQL; React + Vite frontend. File‑type limits, rate limiting, and audit logging are enabled. AI via OpenRouter when credits are available; graceful fallbacks exist.”

0:56 – Close
“Kitako converts alternative financial traces into verifiable proof‑of‑income—helping lenders assess fairly and borrowers access ethical credit.”
